# Hi, I'm Mai Hesham!🤝
✨ I'm still a student at Al-Azhar University's College of Engineering, and I have a strong interest in programming and everything related to it. However, my true passion lies in the field of data science.
🤩 I love to learn and share knowledge, and I thrive in group settings and with friends who share similar interests. 
🔥 I'm eager to dive deeper into the world of data science and work on more projects that can make a positive impact on the world.

## 🙆‍♀️ As a beginner in this field, here are some of the projects where I've applied what I've learned:
✈️[Airline Customer Satisfaction](https://github.com/MaiHesham103/Airlines-Customer-Satisfaction/blob/main/airlines-customer-satisfaction-eda-modeling.ipynb)
  This project aims to analyze and improve airline passenger satisfaction through data-driven insights and predictive modeling.
  
🚴‍♀️[Predict count of Bike Sharing Demand](https://github.com/MaiHesham103/Predict-count-of-Bike-Sharing-Demand./blob/main/predict-count-of-bike-sharing-demand.ipynb)
  Leveraging machine learning algorithms, this project aims to forecast bike rental counts based on various environmental and seasonal factors, helping to optimize bike 
  availability and improve user convenience.
  
🧠[Brain stroke classification](https://github.com/MaiHesham103/Brain-stroke-classification/blob/main/brain-stroke-classification.ipynb)
  This project predicts stroke risk using data-driven machine learning, empowered by resampling techniques, to advance healthcare.
